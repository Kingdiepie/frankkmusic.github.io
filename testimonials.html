<p>
Frank, you are so good about all the details-contract, setting up, playing someone's favorite tune, playing just one more song, and always ending with a patriotic song.  Your price is very fair and once you are booked, I never have to worry about a thing.  I know you will be there, on time, and with a smile on your face.  We look forward to your next performance and know it will be the best!"

			Hi David and Trish,<p>

Just wanted to send a note and say thanks for booking Frank for our Fish Fry last night - he was great!  Perfect fit for the event, and what a nice guy!  All the guests and our general manager loved him and thought he added the perfect touch for the event.<p>

We are thinking of planning another event like this in a few months.  I will definitely be in touch to see if we can have Frank perform again.
<p>
Thanks again!
